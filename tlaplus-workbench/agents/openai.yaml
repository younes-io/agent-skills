  default_prompt: "Turn a natural-language system design into a minimal TLA+ spec (.tla) and TLC model config (.cfg), run TLC model checking, summarize results/counterexamples with explicit bounds and assumptions, and iterate until either properties pass (within bounds) or a counterexample remains."
